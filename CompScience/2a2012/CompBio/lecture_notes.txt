Lecture 3 Computational Biology
February 16, 2012
Lecture 2 page 5 - Lecture 3 page 3

Terms to look up: 
- restriction enzymes
- Cloning using bacteria (cutting open bacterial DNA and insert human gene for reproduction)
- Complementary DNA
- Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) (see very clear slide)
- Sanger sequencing
- Microarrays
- 454 sequencing
- genome/gene (relation with proteins)
- microRNA (showing up much more in animals than plants)
- types of genetic disorder
- homology

How to find non-coding regions in DNA?
- look for sequences not coding for amino acids

Why is the human genome so small and has less genes than plants?
- increasing complexity between genes
- microRNA
- many other reasons

Sequence alignment, how to decide where to insert gaps?
- PAM250 mutation matrix

Lecture 4 Computational Biology
February 20, 2012
Lecture 3 page 3 - Lecture 3 page 12

Terms to look up:
- dynamic programming (sequence analysis)
- FASTA/BLAST algorithm
- Pearson coefficient = \sum (x_i - x_bar)(y_i - y_bar) / \sqrt (\sum (x_i - x_bar)^2 \sum (y_i - y_bar)^2)
  p close to 1 -> strong linear correlation
- Spearman coefficient (look up what it does!)
  coefficient = \sum (r_i_x - r_x_bar) \sum (r_i_y - r_y_bar) / \sqrt (\sum (r_i_x - r_x_bar)^2 \sum (r_i_y - r_y_bar)^2)


How to solve sequence alignment?
- Dynamic programming (score function, causes problems)
- Cluster analysis
- Simulated annealing
- Genetic algorithms

Why is a constant penalty not fair?
- Multiple subsequent permutations are much less likely than one (which happens frequently in meiosis)
